## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We are assisting Maria in removing Thomas High School’s 9th grade math and reading scores from the overall analysis as there is evidence that the scores may have been dishonest. We must remove these test scores and recalculate our analysis for the school board to uphold the integrity of their state-testing scores.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?<br/>

The district summary was not affected greatly overall. Removing a small group of 9th graders from Thomas High School was not enough to greatly swing any of the district summary data percentages.<br/>

- How is the school summary affected?<br/>
The school summary also reflected small changes. The altered 9th grade scores did not contribute greatly to the overall success of THS.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?<br/>
As stated above, the removal of the 9th grade student scores didn't affect THS's performance.  The remaining grade levels still carried high scores to reflect how great THS is as this landed the school in the top 5 performing schools: <br/>

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: <br/>
  - Math and reading scores by grade<br/>
  - Scores by school spending<br/>
  - Scores by school size<br/>
  - Scores by school type<br/>

## Summary
In summary, looking at the dataframes generated throughout this project has proven to me that where a student attends school can greatly determine their success. Students that attend a charter school, have a bigger spending budget per student, and a medium sized school can have higher testing scores. This could be due to the fact that they have access to better resources and could have a better class size that is conducive to a better education.
